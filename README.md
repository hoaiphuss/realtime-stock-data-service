## Summary

This project was developed based on a real-world request from a technology partner, with the goal of **rebuilding and optimizing a stock market data delivery system** for analysis and market trend prediction. The existing system relied on a third-party data provider (VietStock), which required replacement due to changes in data availability.

The new system connects directly to **DNSE via the MQTT protocol** to receive real-time stock data, processes and stores the data in an internal database, and exposes it to the client’s core system through **RESTful APIs** with full schema compatibility. In addition, an **AI-powered Chatbox module** is integrated to allow users to query market data, ask questions, and receive real-time analytical insights.

The solution is designed to ensure **data accuracy, low latency, high availability during trading sessions**, and scalability, while also providing a reliable foundation for future market analysis and intelligent investment recommendation features.

## Key Features

The system implements an automated MQTT session lifecycle aligned with trading hours, including scheduled connect/disconnect, health checks, and self-healing reconnection with exponential backoff. It features secure token-based authentication, centralized token refresh, and robust error alerting via email. Real-time quotes are validated, normalized, cached in memory, and conditionally persisted to MongoDB to reduce redundant writes. A caching-first data access layer ensures fast API responses, while background jobs handle cache cleanup and system health monitoring.

## Project Notice

This repository is a **simplified clone of the official NestJS starter project**, created for learning and demonstration purposes with a reduced technology stack.
